PHI-core
================================
A group of utilities written in JavaScript, for an Easily creation of MooTools plugins.

The features are divided in sets, for set is aimed a group of functions and variables, performing a specific task.

Notations:
1 - [optional text]: the text in square brackets is optional, it can contain both variables and resulting
2 - (One | Two): one of them
3 - {text}: The text between braces is just an example and is intended as guidance of what there is in reality.
3a- {variable}: the value of the variable

The existing sets are:
1 - PHI
contains the main functions of the plugin and all the other sets
2 - CSS
contains functions for manipulating Stylesheets linked to this page


DESCRIPTION:

PHI
The basic set includes:

Functions:
id ([prefix, length]) - returns a string to use as self-generated id, the format of the string is:
	phi-[{prefix} -]{numbers randomized in length ({length} | 10)}
The generated string is checked to avoid duplication.

Example
	PHI.id () -> generates a string of "phi-" and ten random numbers.
	PHI.id ( 'test') -> generates a string of "phi-test-" and ten random numbers.
	PHI.id ( 'test', 5) -> generates a string of "phi-test-and five random numbers.

Variables:
	_generatedList: array - an array containing the ID generated by the function id () used to check for duplication.
